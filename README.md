NodeMcu Based Smart Neopixels Array WiFi Lamp's Firmware.

It's a loaded with modifications and a fixed fork of [gunner47](github.com/gunner47/gyverlamp) firmware for a [Smart Fire Lamp](https://alexgyver.ru/gyverlamp/) project.

So, most of the wiring, hardware, etc. explanations I'll leave to the source since I haven't done significant changes to the hardware or apk part. 
However, it isn't in English - so feel free to ask questions or translations of confusing moments.
